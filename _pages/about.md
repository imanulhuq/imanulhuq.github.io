Howdy, May Peace be on you!

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Nitesh Saxena at the SPIES Lab, Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA.

I began my Ph.D. in Spring 2022. My broader research interests lie in cognitive security and human-centered cybersecurity, with a focus on understanding how human cognitive states—such as fatigue, attention, and perceptual limitations—affect security-critical decision-making. My recent work investigates user susceptibility to phishing attacks, deepfakes, and encryption usability failures through controlled behavioral experiments combined with multimodal physiological sensing, including EEG and eye tracking. Through this work, I aim to bridge cognitive science and systems security, providing empirically grounded insights that inform the design of more robust, human-aware security mechanisms.

My research involves the design and execution of longitudinal and fatigue-aware security experiments, large-scale multimodal data analysis, and the development of reproducible experimental pipelines. I am particularly interested in adversarial settings where attackers exploit cognitive overload or trust assumptions, and in identifying the limits of human perception in detecting sophisticated digital deception. My work is targeted toward top-tier security and privacy venues, and several projects are currently under review or in preparation for submission.
