"Dr. Saxena and/or one of his TAs responded to every message I sent within the hour of sending it, weekday or weekend. I was blown away by that and truly grateful to have that support as a remote student."

Student review at Coursicle
"110 is hard if without coding experience. Yum takes attendance when numbers are low. Uneventful lectures, so I mainly worked on labs and homework. Tests + quizzes are hard, so aim for high grades on labs and homework. Labs progress at faster rate than lecture, & the TA + PT were the reason why I had 100s on labs. Go to class/lab & you'll be good."

Student review at Rate My Professor:
"Great professor. He takes attendance 10 times for 10% of the grade but if you attend class like you're supposed to, it's easy 10%. Quizzes are graded a harshly with little to no partial credit but the labs are easy with great TAs and homeworks are rather straightforward. There is a clear grading criteria so make sure you follow the format exactly."
